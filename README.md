# Valoria – Text-Based RPG Game 

## Overview
Valoria is a terminal-based role-playing game written in Python. The game follows a branching narrative where player choices directly affect the storyline, combat encounters, and ending. Players select a class, manage stats, fight enemies, and make moral decisions that shape the fate of the kingdom.

This project demonstrates game logic, object-like state handling, turn-based combat, and interactive storytelling using core Python.

## Features
